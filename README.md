# mongo-level

![level badge](https://leveljs.org/img/badge.svg)

This is an [abstract-level](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) adapter for MongoDB. While it does pass all the abstract-level tests, it is not production ready yet.

To run the tests, run the Docker compose script to start up the test DB and then run the npm tests as normal:
```
docker compose up
npm run test
```
